# Millet for 15-150 students

If you're reading this, you might be an enterprising [15-150][] student attempting to get Millet working with course handouts.

I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, it's possible that you may need to tweak your code a bit for Millet to understand it.

Note that, at time of writing, Millet is **not officially supported** by the 15-150 staff. It's inadvisable to ask TAs how to set up or debug Millet, since they might not even know what it is.

That being said, some rudimentary support is distributed in the course handouts, to hopefully make
using Millet easier.

## Support for `$` paths

Millet requires some help to understand certain ML Basis features used by 15-150 handout files.

Notably, MLB files distributed by 15-150 often reference a custom `$` path, `ONEFIFTY-LIB`. This
custom path is defined to allow for easy access to 150's special libraries.

This is problematic for Millet, because Millet doesn't know about the `ONEFIFTY-LIB` path variable.

To fix, we must tell Millet about custom path variables via another means, `millet.toml`. The course
handout should already have this file, but you may need to change it depending on your workflow.

### Example

Consider this partial directory structure:

```
handout/
  code/
    problem1/
      ...
    problem2/
      ...
    ...
    sources.mlb
  lib/
    lib1/
    lib2/
    ...
```

The root directory is called `handout`.

In the `code` directory we have a number of subdirectories for each problem. The `sources.mlb`
links all these problems together (to make using Millet easier). There is also a `lib` directory
containing all the relevant libraries for the handout.

We need to setup two things. First, we need to tell Millet about `code/sources.mlb` so it can know
about all the problems. We also need to let Millet know what `ONEFIFTY-LIB` is referring to.

To tell Millet about these things, we make `handout/millet.toml` with these contents:

```toml
version = 1
[workspace]
root = "code/sources.mlb"
[workspace.path-vars]
ONEFIFTY-LIB = { path = "lib" }
```

This tells Millet that the "root" `sources.mlb` is at `code/sources.mlb`. And it also tells Millet
that `ONEFIFTY-LIB` should point to the `lib` directory.

## Source files must be in order

If you are using MLB files (which is likely the case) this is already enforced.

If something went wrong, and you are using CM files, then Millet requires that the files listed be
in order.

It is a feature of CM that source files within a CM file may be listed out of order. A conforming implementation of CM, such as the one that ships with SML/NJ, will determine the correct order in
which to process these source files.

Millet is not a conforming implementation, and it uses the order of SML files listed in CM as the
order in which it actually analyzes the files.

### Example

In the following example, Millet will emit an "undefined" error for the reference to the structure `Foo` in `Bar.sml`, but SML/NJ will accept the code without errors.

This is because Millet will attempt to analyze `Bar.sml` before `Foo.sml`, because `Bar.sml` comes before `Foo.sml` in the `sources.cm` file.

#### `sources.cm`

```sml-nj-cm
Group is
  Bar.sml
  Foo.sml
```

#### `Foo.sml`

```sml
structure Foo = struct
  val x = 123
end
```

#### `Bar.sml`

```sml
val _ = Foo.x
```

To have the code be accepted by both SML/NJ and Millet, change the order of the files listed in `sources.cm` to list first `Foo.sml`, then `Bar.sml`.

```diff
--- a/sources.cm
+++ b/sources.cm
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 Group is
-  Bar.sml
   Foo.sml
+  Bar.sml
```

## Some SML/NJ-isms are not accepted

SML/NJ deviates from the formal [Definition of Standard ML][sml-def] in a few places. Millet accepts and analyzes programs with some of these deviations, but not others.

For instance:

- The Definition forbids `signature` and `functor` declarations to appear within both `local` declarations and `struct ... end` structure-level expressions.
- Millet allows only the former.
- SML/NJ allows both.

Most SML/NJ deviations have been removed, but if some were missed you may have to rewrite some SML handout code.

For instance, here's an example of rewriting to avoid using a `functor` within a `functor`.

```diff
--- a/code/foo/MkFoo.sml
+++ b/code/foo/MkFoo.sml

+  structure Depth10 = struct structure Options = Options val search_depth = 10 end

   structure Bar3 = MkBar (Depth3)
   structure Bar5 = MkBar (Depth5)
```

## Last resort: turn off the language server

If the errors are too hard to fix, you can turn off the language server for specific directories.

In VS Code, open "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings", search for `millet.server.enabled`, and set
it to `false`.

The language server will continue to be enabled by default if you open a different folder. This is useful if you want to disable Millet for only one particularly tricky handout.

This doesn't disable SML syntax highlighting, snippets, etc.
